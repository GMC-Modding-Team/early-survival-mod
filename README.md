# Introduction

```markdown
This mod started off as two separate mods `Wilderness Overhaul` and `Wild Living` but also includes `Cloth Roll mat`, `More_tea_leaf` and `Rice.` My intention is to make this a finished mod for CDDA.
I wanted to expand the early game and living in the bush or wild living if you will. This is a focused expansion and will be part of a bigger mod that will expand early game and wild living. I want to expand this as much as I can so there is nothing left.

Included mods - `Wilderness Overhaul`, `Wild Living`, `Cloth Roll Mat` `More Tea Leaf`, `Rice Mod`, `Natural Brewing`, `More Survival Tools`, `Primitive plank`, `Anaesthetic Crafting`, `Bim Jakkers Buckets`, `Broken Admins Makeshift Items`, `Crude Improvised`, `Camping tools`, `Cursed Thighs`, `Dried Food`, `Survivors Crowbar`, `Your Gonna Get Canned`, `Makeshift Canteen`, `more_crafting`
